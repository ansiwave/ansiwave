This is an experimental desktop version of [ANSIWAVE BBS](https://github.com/ansiwave/ansiwave) rendered with OpenGL.

To make a release build, [install Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) and do:

```
nimble build -d:release
```

Non-release builds point to a local server so they won't connect to the real BBS server.
