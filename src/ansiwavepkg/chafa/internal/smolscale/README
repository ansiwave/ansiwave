Smolscale
=========

Smolscale is a smol piece of C code for quickly scaling images to a reasonable
level of quality using CPU resources only (no GPU). It operates on 4-channel
data with 32 bits per pixel, i.e. packed RGBA, ARGB, BGRA, etc. It supports
both premultiplied and unassociated alpha and can convert between the two. It
is host byte ordering agnostic.

The design goals are:

* High throughput: Optimized code, within reason. Easily parallelizable.

* Decent quality: No "jaggies" as produced by nearest-neighbor scaling.

* Low memory overhead: Mostly on the stack.

* Simplicity: A modern C toolchain as the only dependency.

* Ease of use: One-shot and row-batch APIs.

Usage
-----

First, read COPYING. If your project meets the requirements, you should be
able to copy the following files into it and add it to your build with
minimal fuss:

  smolscale.c
  smolscale.h
  smolscale-private.h

If you want AVX2 SIMD support, optionally copy this additional file and
compile everything with -DSMOL_WITH_AVX2:

  smolscale-avx2.c

Keep in mind that this file is mostly just a straight copy of the generic
code for the time being. Still, you will get a performance boost by building
it with -mavx2 and letting Smolscale pick the implementation at runtime.

The API documentation lives in smolscale.h along with the public declarations.
