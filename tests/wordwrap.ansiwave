I always thought that one man, the lone balladeer with the guitar could blow a whole army off the stage if he knew what he was doing, I've seen it happen. It's important to stay away from the celebrity trap. The media is a great meatgrinder, it's never satisfied and it must be fed, but there's power in the darkness too and in keeping things hidden. Some guys got it down - Leonard Cohen, Paul Brady, Lou Reed, secret heroes - John Prine, David Allen Coe, Tom Waits, I listen more to that kind of stuff than whatever is popular at the moment, they're not just witchdoctoring up the planet, they don't set up barriers. Gordon Lightfoot, everytime I hear a song of his, it's like I wish it would last forever.
